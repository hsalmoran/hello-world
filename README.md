I'm currently a junior in Muir College, Double majoring in Cognitive Science: Design Interaction and Urban Studies and Planning! I switched workplaces too so I'm hoping to have a fulfilling quarter and perform well in my classes! 2 of them are project-based, and the other 2 are exam based so this quarter really will test my communication/presentation skills.
